# Shortest Paths
Finds the shortest path on a grid between two nodes (given by the user). The user also puts obstacles which the path must not go through (but can go in between to walls ...).

# Dependencies
• Python 3.10

• Pygame to make the GUI.

# Known Bugs
• Since my code uses the A* Pathfinding Algorithm which involves hueristics, it is not gauranteed that the output is the shortest path.

• Due to the same reason, it says "No Path Found" when there actually is a path.
